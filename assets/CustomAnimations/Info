Every folder contains one .js, .html and .css file. 
Html and css are only ment to give you an impression of how the animation might look like in the end
and of course to have an overview over the most important elements of the animation.

the .js files are not yet functions to be called. Only working js. After deciding which to use and finishing all adjustments we can 
encapsulate them as functions for easier use.
